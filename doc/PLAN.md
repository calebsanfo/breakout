# Game Plan
## Caleb Sanford
### Breakout Variant
I think that the Bricks and Balls variant of breakout is interesting 
and can be expanded upon by adding a paddle to keep some balls in play.
I thinks that this game will be different because of the number 
of balls that are moving. It will allow a player to initially shoot
the balls as well as return the balls to play.

### General Level Descriptions
The game will include 10 levels, each requiring more bricks to be 
destroyed. Each level must be completed in 3 shots (or lives). An 
increasing number of balls will be shot each level.

### Bricks Ideas
* The bricks will have random values associated with them that determines 
the number of times they must be hit to be destroyed. 
* Green bricks will add to the number of balls in play.
* A red brick will be an explosive brick that will damage the bricks 
around it when destroyed. 

### Power Up Ideas
* Each level will include bricks that add different number of balls to
the amount in play when destroyed.
* If over half of the bricks are destroyed on a single turn, the paddle 
will double in width for the remainder of the level.


### Cheat Key Ideas
* When a key is pressed, the paddle will shoot a laser that will destroy 
any bricks in its path.
* When a secret key is pressed all of the balls in play will do double 
the damage when they makes contact with a block. 


### Something Extra
When an explosive block is destroyed, an explosion animation will 
show. The size of the explosion will vary based on the strength of 
the block. This is a substantial addition because the animation will be 
programed from scratch.
